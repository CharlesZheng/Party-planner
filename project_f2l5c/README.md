# My Personal Project

## Party planner 

- ### What will the application do?  
This app is a **party planner**. Basically this app is to help us to plan our party, it can show how many people are 
coming and who are they, also it can show whether this person is for sure coming or he is still deciding. Also, this 
can list the stuff we need to prepare like alcohol and cake. And sometimes we need to split the bill like the stuff we
buy all together, it shows how much each person needs to pay.

- ### Who will use it?
I personally think this is really useful for the people who like party and help them to *organize and plan the party*. 
Also, for the people who want to attend party, it can show they what the party like and help them to *decide whether 
they will come or not*.

- ### Why is this project of interest to you?
The reason why I want to design this app is that I partied a lot last semester and most of the time was my roommates,
and I organized and planned the party, we had to memorize all the people who are coming, or sometimes they might not
sure about whether they will come or not  and things we need to prepare , so there are many things we need to remember 
and do, by designing this app it can help us to do the planning, and we can plan our party in a more **efficient** way.

Phrase 4; Task 3.
 If I have more time first thing that I want to do is that I want to change my guest class to interface or abstract 
class and let my deciding Guest extends it since there are many repeated codes in my program. I want to change them into 
abstract methods, that can largely decrease the repetition of my code. Also, for the status of my gust I used enum 
however when I initialize it I use String for the status, I got really confused when I designed other functionalities of
my program. Meanwhile, I want let my "theGuestThatHasBeenMoved" extends guest it can also reduce the repetition of my 
code.
